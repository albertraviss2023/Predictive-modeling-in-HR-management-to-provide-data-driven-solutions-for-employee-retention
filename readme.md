In this project, we analyze a dataset and build predictive models using Python, to provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.
As a final deliverable, we will have a brief one-page summary to present to the stakeholders to allow them to make data-driven decisions. 
In short, we will analyze the data using a regression model and machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. 
Both approaches should yield the same results.

In the deliverables, we will also include the model evaluation, interpretation, data visualization, ethical considerations, 
and the resources we used to troubleshoot and find answers to the questions asked.
